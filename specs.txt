Restaurant Finder Coding Challenge (November 2025)
Task Overview
Build an LLM-Driven Restaurant Finder API that allows users to enter a free‑form message
describing what they want to do. The system should then:
Convert the natural language message into a structured JSON command using an LLM

Use the JSON command to call the Foursquare Places API for restaurant data.

Expose an GET API endpoint that can be used in the browser to view JSON results
of the restaurant data. The user must provide a code
 parameter pioneerdevai

 to prevent unauthorized access.

Foursquare API:
Updated Place Search: https://docs.foursquare.com/fsq-developers-places/reference/place-search
Place details (alternative) : https://docs.foursquare.com/fsq-developers-places/reference/place-details

Example Workflow:
User Input:
"Find me a cheap sushi restaurant in downtown Los Angeles that's open now and has at 
least a 4-star rating."

LLM Conversion:
The LLM converts the input into a JSON command similar to:
​
Downstream API Call:
Use this JSON to query the Foursquare Places API. 
The API should return detailed restaurant information including:
Name
Address
Cuisine
Rating (optional)
Price Level (optional)
Operating Hours (optional)

Display Results:
No UI needed. Just expose an GET endpoint that returns JSON that can be viewed in a browser.

Technical Requirements
Language & Framework:

API Endpoints:
Route:  GET /api/execute?message=<your_query>&code=pioneerdevai
 that uses URL encoding

Example route:
GET /api/execute?message=Find%20me%20a%20cheap%20sushi%20restaurant%20in%20downtown%20Los%20Angeles%20that's%20open%20now%20and%20has%20at%20least%20a%204-star%20rating&code=pioneerdevai

Note it is using URL encoding for message parameters
Original message is Find me a cheap sushi restaurant in downtown Los Angeles that's open now and has at least a 4-star rating.

Workflow:
First validate the code
 is pioneerdevai
If not, return a 401

Downstream API Call:
Use the parsed JSON to extract fields.
Call the Foursquare Places API using the provided parameters. Ensure you handle 
authentication using API keys stored as environment variables.

Return Results:
Parse the response from the Foursquare API and return a well‑structured JSON object 
containing key restaurant details.
You should only return the restaurant information that is relevant based on the user’s message.

Display Results
Since it’s a GET request returning JSON, the result can be viewed in a browser or Postman.

Security & Best Practices:
Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys for Foursquare and the LLM provider) in environment
variables.
Implement error handling for invalid inputs or unexpected API responses.

Environment:
Provide clear setup instructions in a README to run the application locally.

Deployment
Deploy the service on the deployment platform of your choice (Fly.io, Vercel, etc). Free tiers should be sufficient.

Evaluation Criteria:
Functionality:
Does the app work well for the basic use cases? How about more complicated cases?

Code Quality:
Is the code clean, modular, well‑documented, and type‑safe?

Implementation:
Does the backend properly convert natural language into structured JSON, 
handle API interactions with Foursquare, and manage errors gracefully?

Efficiency:
Is the application performant and responsive for the task’s scope?

Commit History:
Are there clear and logical commits demonstrating your development process?

Creativity:
Are any optional or unique enhancements implemented effectively?

Security:
Are best practices followed to secure sensitive data (e.g., API keys)?

Include a README with:
Setup instructions for running the app locally.
Details on configuring environment variables.
Any assumptions or limitations in your implementation.
